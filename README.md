# 🧠 Big Picture: The Graphics Stack

## Here’s the hierarchy, from lowest to highest level:

```plaintext
GPU Hardware (NVIDIA / AMD / Intel)
↓
Driver (provided by GPU manufacturer)
↓
Graphics API (OpenGL, Vulkan, DirectX, Metal, WebGPU)
↓
Window & Context Layer (GLFW, SDL, etc.)
↓
Rendering Abstraction (RHI, Renderer Module)
↓
Game Engine (Scene, ECS, Materials, Lighting, etc.)
↓
Game Logic / Gameplay Code
```

## 🔹 1. GPU Hardware

The GPU is a specialized processor designed for parallel data processing, especially useful for rendering images.

It has:

Shader cores (for vertex/fragment/pixel operations)

VRAM (video memory)

Rasterizer, texture units, etc.

But you can’t talk directly to the GPU from your app — it’s too low-level and proprietary.

👉 That’s why we need drivers and graphics APIs.

## 🔹 2. Drivers

GPU vendors (like NVIDIA, AMD, Intel) provide drivers that implement the API specification.
For example:

OpenGL driver on Windows by NVIDIA

Vulkan driver by AMD on Linux

They handle:

Translating API calls (like glDrawElements) into hardware commands

Managing GPU memory, shaders, and state

Think of drivers as the translators between API code and the actual GPU hardware.

## 🔹 3. Graphics API (OpenGL, Vulkan, DirectX, Metal, WebGPU)

These are software specifications that define what the driver must support and how you can access GPU features.

OpenGL – Older but simpler; state machine–based.

Vulkan / DirectX 12 / Metal – Modern, explicit control, more efficient but complex.

WebGPU – Modern API for browsers (based on Vulkan/Metal/DX12 concepts).

So when you write:
```cpp
glDrawElements(GL_TRIANGLES, count, GL_UNSIGNED_INT, 0);
```
You’re not drawing directly — you’re calling a function that is implemented in the driver, which sends GPU commands to render.

## 🔹 4. Windowing & Context (GLFW, SDL, etc.)

You mentioned GLFW — great question.

GLFW is not part of OpenGL itself.
It’s a helper library that does things OpenGL doesn’t handle, like:

Creating a window (glfwCreateWindow)

Creating an OpenGL context (required to use GL functions)

Handling input (keyboard, mouse, joystick)

Managing timing and events

Without something like GLFW (or SDL, or platform-specific APIs like Win32/X11/Cocoa), you can’t actually show your OpenGL-rendered image on screen.

So:

OpenGL = how to draw

GLFW/SDL = where to draw and how to handle input

## 🔹 5. Rendering Abstraction (e.g., Unreal Engine’s RHI)

This is where engine-level abstraction begins.

The Render Hardware Interface (RHI) in Unreal is a C++ layer that hides the graphics API behind a unified interface.

For example:
```cpp
RHICommandList->DrawIndexedPrimitive(...);
```
might call internally:
```cpp
glDrawElements()							// on OpenGL,
vkCmdDrawIndexed()							// on Vulkan,
ID3D12CommandList::DrawIndexedInstanced()	// on DirectX 12.
```
So your engine code doesn’t care what graphics API is underneath — it just calls the RHI.

This allows:

- Multi-platform support (same engine, different backends)
- Easier maintenance
- Cleaner architecture


## 🔹 6. Game Engine Layer

Above the RHI, you have engine systems like:
- Scene Graph
- Entity Component System (ECS)
- Materials / Shaders
- Lighting / Shadows / Physics
- Camera & Post-Processing
These use the RHI to render scenes, load assets, and manage GPU resources.

## 🔹 7. Game Logic Layer

Finally, your game scripts, AI, input handling, and gameplay logic live here — completely abstracted from GPU details.

They only interact with higher-level concepts (like “render this model” or “spawn a particle effect”), not “bind this VBO and issue draw call.”

# 🧩 So, Your Conclusion Is Correct:

“If we take OpenGL and abstract it, we have classes and function calls that combine specific utilities — we have created our game engine.”

✅ Yes — that’s exactly how all major engines (Unreal, Unity, Godot, Frostbite) are built.

Each engine defines its own rendering interface layer (RHI, RenderDevice, etc.) that wraps low-level API calls.

# 🧭 Suggested Learning Path to Build Your Own Rendering Engine

- Understand OpenGL well
- Vertex buffers, shaders, framebuffers, textures
- Rendering pipeline stages
- Write a small rendering wrapper
- Create your own Renderer class that hides OpenGL calls.
Example:
```cpp
class Renderer
{
	public:
		void DrawMesh(const Mesh& mesh, const Shader& shader);
};
```
- Add abstraction layers
- Add interfaces like IGraphicsAPI, ITexture, IShader
- Implement backends for OpenGL, Vulkan, etc.
- Integrate window/input layer
- Use GLFW or SDL2
- Create higher-level systems
- Scene graph, ECS, material system, camera, lighting
- Modularize your codebase
- Core/ → memory, math, logging
- Renderer/ → abstraction and API
- Engine/ → gameplay, world
- Editor/ → tools and UI
